## 🧪 Performance Considerations

This project uses several optimization techniques:

- **Mipmaps:** Enabled for all texture assets  
- **Static Batching:** Hub environment marked static  
- **GPU Instancing:** Applied to repeating materials (planets, props)  
- **LOD Groups:** Used for large 3D models for distance optimization  
- **Texture Atlases:** Some imported assets already include atlases  
- **IL2CPP Build Target:** Used for optimized builds  
- **Occlusion Culling:** Considered only where necessary  

Screenshots of optimization settings included in GDD.

## 📖 Project Purpose

VR Explorer Hub aligns with my mission at ALU:  
**to use immersive technology to improve access to education, turning complicated concepts into interactive, visual experiences that anyone can understand.**

This prototype demonstrates the potential of VR in transforming learning across Africa and beyond.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- More anatomy modules (lungs, brain)  
- More astronomical content (moons, galaxies)  
- Narration / guided tours  
- Interactive quizzes  
- Multi-user support  
- Improved animations and visual effects
